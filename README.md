# Python projects 
A mix of hobby, research, and coursework projects written in Python.

### Projects
1. Tweet sentiment extraction: Using a BERT deep learning model, I extracted sentiments from tweets. This was a final project for a course in Deep Learning where I could choose my own challenge. I chose to do a Kaggle competition, which is where the data comes from. 
2. Game: I made a trivia game using tkinter called Non-Linear History. It is nerdy and quizzes the player on facts about notable statisticians in recent history.
