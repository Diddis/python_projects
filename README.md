# Python projects 
A mix of hobby, research, and coursework projects written in Python.

### Projects
1. **Tweet sentiment extraction**: Using a BERT deep learning model, I extracted sentiments from tweets. This was a final project for a course in Deep Learning where I could choose my own challenge. I chose to do a Kaggle competition, which is where the data comes from.
2. **Word2vec**: I explored word embeddings using Google's Word2vec model trained on a Google News dataset. Word2vec models are used for natural language processing. The model converts text into numerical vectors that represent relationships among words. It can identify similar words and suggest new words. 
3. **Game**: I made a trivia game using tkinter called Non-Linear History. It is nerdy and quizzes the player on facts about notable statisticians in recent history.
